## Todo

- [x] Make it that bot runs without some of the code from the original DiscordBot.
- [x] Clean up the code a bit.
    - [ ] Clean up the code some more.
- [x] Make it so that !help takes arguments, so it can explain functions independently.
- [x] Add permissions to certain commands. (Like !pullanddeploy, !online, !idle)
    - [ ] Make permissions more advanced.
- [x] Add more memes and abbreviations for the !meme and !game commands.
    - [ ] Add even more memes and abbreviations.
    - [ ] Create a function that will pull the popular memes from Imgflip, and integrate them automatically.
- [x] Integrate !memehelp into !help.
- [ ] Integrate a WolframAlpha command. The original DiscordBot had one, but that didn't work.
- [x] Make it so that log files are written when !log is used, instead of printing them to the console.
- [x] Make it so that !help outputs into a DM, instead of printing it into the channel.
- [x] Integrate Cleverbot support, but restrict it to a certain channel.
- [ ] Integrate a function to make DiscordBot stream music to a certain voice channel. (discord.js is being rewritten to support voice.)
- [ ] Create a function to make DiscordBot create text/voice channels, but restrict it to a certain permission.
- [ ] Add webhooks to discord to show when someone updates github
